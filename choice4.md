# Examine the Symbols

You kneel beside one of the glowing trees and run your fingers over the carved symbols. They're warm—almost pulsing with life.

Suddenly, a shock runs through your hand. A flood of memories not your own rushes into your mind: battles, rituals, guardians, and a warning—*leave before the gate closes forever.*

The air thickens, and you realize you're not supposed to be here.

You turn and run back through the forest, the trees groaning around you. The crow screeches in protest, but you don't look back.

After what feels like hours, you burst out of the forest into sunlight. Your compass spins one last time, then stops.

You survived the Whispering Woods. But the symbols remain burned into your memory… and sometimes, at night, you hear your name whispered in the wind.

**The End.**
