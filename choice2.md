# ‚Å†Enter the forest through the left path

You choose the left path and push through the thick foliage. The air is damp, and the trees grow closer together as you move forward.

Suddenly, you stumble into a clearing. In the center stands a weathered stone altar, surrounded by broken statues of creatures with wings and claws. A strange wind circles the altar, despite the stillness of the forest.

Behind it, a narrow trail leads deeper into the woods, where you can barely make out the faint light of a flickering flame.
