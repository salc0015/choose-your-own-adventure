## The Whispering Woods

Centuries ago, a forest blanketed a land now erased from modern maps. They say it can still be found—if you know where to look... and if you're willing to pay the price to enter.

You, Alex Rivera, are an archaeology student with a passion for ancient legends. One day, while browsing through old books in your university library, you discover a hand-drawn map tucked between the pages of a dusty volume. The map leads to an unmarked region, with a cryptic message: *"Where the trees whisper, the sleeping truth awaits."*

Curiosity gets the best of you. You follow the map and arrive at a dense forest, shrouded in fog. The trees seem to breathe, and your compass spins wildly. A black crow watches you silently from a low branch.

Then, you hear it—a whisper calling your name from within the woods.
