# Step Through the Archway

You step through the glowing archway.

For a second, everything goes silent. No fog, no whispers—just a strange warmth and a violet light flooding your vision. When your eyes adjust, you find yourself standing in a clearing where the trees are taller, golden, and the air hums with quiet magic.

In the center, a circular stone platform glows with ancient runes.

As you approach it, the crow reappears, but now it's larger—wings outstretched, eyes burning with a blue flame. It speaks in a voice deep and old.

_"You have been chosen, Alex Rivera. The forest accepts your presence."_

The platform rises, and light surrounds you completely. You feel your body shift—like you're no longer just human, but part of something ancient.

You are never seen again, but legends begin to speak of a new guardian in the Whispering Woods.

**The End.**
