# Follow the Crow

You decide to follow the crow. It flutters from branch to branch, always just ahead of you, as if guiding you somewhere.

The deeper you go, the thicker the fog becomes. Strange symbols appear on the bark of trees—some glowing faintly in your lantern’s light. The crow lets out a loud caw and lands near an ancient stone archway, half-buried in vines.

As you approach, the air around you starts to hum with energy. The arch pulses with a soft blue light. The crow hops to the side and stares at you.
